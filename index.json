Standard particle filter algorithms, which provide an effective approach for general low-dimensional partially observed Markov processes, suffer from a curse of dimensionality that limits their applicability beyond low-dimensional systems. We show that many independent Monte Carlo calculations, none of which, by itself, attempts to solve the filtering problem, can be combined to give a global filtering solution that theoretically beats the curse of dimensionality under weak coupling conditions. The independent Monte Carlo calculations are called islands, and the corresponding algorithm is called a basic island filter (BIF). Carrying out an operation called adapted simulation on each island results in a variant called an adapted simulation island filter (ASIF). Adapted simulation can be implemented using a Monte Carlo technique called intermediate resampling to give the ASIF-IR algorithm which has improved theoretical and empirical scaling. Our focus is on evaluation of the likelihood function, but our algorithms and theory are also pertinent to latent state estimation. We demonstrate our methodology on coupled population dynamics arising in the epidemiology of infectious disease. In this context, our methods retain the generality of particle filter algorithms while scaling to systems an order of magnitude larger.","tags":["Particle filter","sequential Monte Carlo","Markov process","spatiotemporal inference","metapopulation dynamics"],"title":"Island filters for partially observed spatiotemporal systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kidus Asfaw"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1595639498,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595639498,"objectID":"d1e861e939c4099fff7d4ea706e24220","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/dengue/","publishdate":"2020-07-24T21:11:38-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/dengue/","section":"project","summary":"Demonstrated the failure of classical time series models to capture variability in dengue case count data and proceeded to develop a mechanistic model that was fit using the pomp R package","tags":[],"title":"Modeling dengue in San Juan, Puerto Rico","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kidus Asfaw","Laura Niss","Zoe Rehnberg","Ed Wu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1595639257,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595639257,"objectID":"f2d34348c180b867b00195d75714452d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/wapo/","publishdate":"2020-07-24T21:07:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/wapo/","section":"project","summary":"Can the circumstance of a fatal shooting by a police officer be used to predict race?
